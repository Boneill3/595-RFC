# Wildfire Protocol (CS 595)

This was my first attempt at designing and implementing a wildfire 
notification protocol as a project for CS 595 - Internetworking Protocols
at Portland State University, during the Fall 2020 quarter.

I will likely not be updating this implementation and instead, 
please review the ns3 simulation of the protocol, which can 
be found at https://github.com/Boneill3/ns3-wildfire-application
